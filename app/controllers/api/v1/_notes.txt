It is because your returned data does not include user information. In your ajax call response, you cannot query as if you are in rails controller.

In your case, you should return user information together with post in your controller action.

post = Post.find(params[:id])
user = post.user
post = post.as_json
post[:user] = user.as_json
render json: { post: post }


********************************

If you need users information for multiple posts, you can use eager loading in your rails controller action

@posts = Post.includes(:user).all.map do |post|
           post_json = post.as_json
           post_json[:user] = post.user.as_json
           post_json
         end

render json: { posts: @posts }
